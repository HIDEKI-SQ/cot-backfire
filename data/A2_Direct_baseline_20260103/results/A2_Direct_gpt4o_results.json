The time it takes him to get home is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{15840 \\text{ feet}}{440 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\n- **Tim's Time:**\n  Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute.

Therefore, Steve is the winner.\n- The time Steve waits for Tim is:\n  \\[\n  40 \\text{ minutes} - 36 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the winner, Steve, will be waiting for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n{\"final\": 4}",

The first house needs half of what the second house needs: \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{2}y\n   \\]\n\n2. The third house needs double what the first house needs:\n   \\[\n   z = 2x\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250:\n   \\[\n   x + y + z = 250\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute the expressions for \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( y \\) into the total equation:\n\nFrom \\( x = \\frac{1}{2}y \\), we have:\n\\[\nz = 2x = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}y\\right) = y\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = \\frac{1}{2}y \\) and \\( z = y \\) into the total equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250\n\\]\n\nConvert \\(\\frac{1}{2}y\\) to a common denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}y = 0.5y\n\\]\n\nAdd the terms:\n\\[\n0.5y + 2y = 2.5y = 250\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{250}{2.5} = 100\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 100 \\), we can find \\( x \\) and \\( z \\):\n- \\( x = \\frac{1}{2}y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50 \\)\n- \\( z = y = 100 \\)\n\nThus, the third house needs \\( z = 100 \\) cases of shingles.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\"final\": 100}",

Therefore, if we let \\( B \\) represent her brother's earnings, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2}B = 5000\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( B \\), we multiply both sides by 2:\n     \\[\n     B = 5000 \\times 2 = 10000\n     \\]\n   - So, her brother earns $10,000 per month.\n\n3. **Combined Earnings of Valerie and Her Brother:**\n   - The combined earnings of Valerie and her brother is:\n     \\[\n     5000 + 10000 = 15000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Mother's Earnings:**\n   - Their mother earns twice their combined salary.
